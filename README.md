Fundamentals:

`Bot` and `Updater` are two object to interact with mirai-http-api.

`Bot` contains all outbound actions (such as `send_group_message`),
 all methods are well documented, and internal methods starts with `_`

`Updater` handles all inbound updates (such as receiving events or messages)

A list of available event is under `mirai_core.models.events.EventTypes`, and each event entity is
 under `mirai_core.models.events`, and shares the same name as `EventTypes`.
 
A list of available message components (to construct MessageChain) is under `mirai_core.models.message.components`.

### Features

- Updater handshake with mirai-console automatically when console is restarted or session is expired

- Similar logic to python-telegram-bot or aiogram

- Supports multiple listener for single event, use `return True` to block further calling for this event only

- Supports Websocket (enabled by default)

- Supports xml/json/app message
